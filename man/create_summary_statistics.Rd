\title{Create Summary Statistics for Specified Variables}
\usage{
create_summary_statistics(data, ..., by = NULL, detail = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables to be summarized.}

\item{...}{Comma-separated list of unquoted variable names in the data frame to summarize.
These variables must be either numeric, integer, or logical.}

\item{by}{An optional unquoted variable name to group the data before summarizing.
If NULL (the default), summary statistics are computed across all observations.}

\item{detail}{Logical flag indicating whether to compute detailed summary statistics
including additional quantiles. Defaults to FALSE, which computes basic
statistics (n, mean, sd, min, median, max). When TRUE, additional quantiles
(1\%, 5\%, 10\%, 25\%, 75\%, 90\%, 95\%, 99\%) are also computed.}
}
\value{
A tibble with summary statistics for each selected variable. If \code{by} is specified,
the output includes the grouping variable as well. Each row represents a variable
(and a group if \code{by} is used), and columns include the computed statistics.
}
\description{
Computes a set of summary statistics for numeric and integer variables in a data frame.
This function allows users to select specific variables for summarization and can
calculate statistics for the whole dataset or within groups specified by the \code{by} argument.
Additional detail levels for quantiles can be included.
}
\details{
The function first checks that all specified variables are of type numeric, integer,
or logical. If any variables do not meet this criterion, the function stops and returns
an error message indicating the non-conforming variables.

The basic set of summary statistics includes the count of non-NA values (n), mean, standard
deviation (sd), minimum (min), median (q50), and maximum (max). If \code{detail} is TRUE, the function
also computes the 1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles.

Summary statistics are computed for each variable specified in \code{...}. If a \code{by} variable
is provided, statistics are computed within each level of the \code{by} variable.
