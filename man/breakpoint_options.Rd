\usage{
breakpoint_options(
  n_portfolio = NULL,
  percentiles = NULL,
  breakpoint_exchanges = NULL,
  smooth_bunching = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_portfolio}{Integer, optional. The number of portfolios to create. Must be a positive integer.
If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{percentiles}{Numeric vector, optional. A vector of percentile thresholds for defining breakpoints.
Each value should be between 0 and 1. If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{breakpoint_exchanges}{Character, optional. A non-empty string specifying the exchange for which the breakpoints apply.
If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{smooth_bunching}{Logical, optional. Indicates whether smooth bunching should be applied. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional optional arguments. These will be captured in the resulting structure as a list.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"tidyfinance_breakpoint_options"} containing the provided breakpoint options,
including any additional arguments passed via \code{...}.
}
\description{
This function generates a structured list of options for defining breakpoints in portfolio sorting.
It includes parameters for the number of portfolios, percentile thresholds, exchange-specific breakpoints,
and smooth bunching, along with additional optional parameters.
